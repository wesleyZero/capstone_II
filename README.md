### Description
This description and readme is a _massive_ simplification of our chemical engineering capstone for the intended audience of software engineers, with the entire emphasis being of how the code was written. For the full detailed report (with the intended audience of chemical engineers) please see the [PDF of our final Report](https://github.com/wesleyZero/capstone_II/blob/main/readme/pdf/capstone2_DMC.pdf).

We (my capstone group) performed a detailed techno-economic analysis and design for a proposed 100 kiloton per year (kta) plant producing polymer-grade Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) for optical applications. Our economic analysis included (but is certainly not limited to) calculations of net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), total capital investment (TCI), energy consumption, carbon emissions, hazard ananylsis, and _much_ more. Those details will be ommitted in this readme since the focus of the following will be the code. 

## How_do_you_simulate_a_chemical_process?

You start off with a process flow diagram, this process flow diagram shows all processes that are included in the chemical processeing plant that we are designing.

**Description** This description and readme is a _massive_ simplification of our chemical engineering capstone for the intended audience of software engineers, with a heavy emphasis of how the code was written. For the full detailed report (with the intended audience of chemical engineers) please see the [PDF of our final Report](https://github.com/wesleyZero/capstone_II/blob/main/readme/pdf/capstone2_DMC.pdf).

This report presents a detailed techno-economic analysis and design for a proposed 100
kiloton per year (kta) plant producing polymer-grade Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) for optical
applications. The analysis was conducted by Chemical Investment Advisors (CIA) on behalf
of the University of California Retirement Savings Program (UCRSP). The motivation for this
project aligns with UCRSPâ€™s decision to divest from fossil fuel companies and invest in green
chemistry initiatives that contribute to carbon dioxide (CO) reduction. The project is characterized by a Net Present Value (NPV) of -$88.9 million, indicating a significant loss under current
economic conditions, and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of -56%, reflecting the unprofitability of the plant without substantial market price adjustments. The Total Capital Investment
(TCI) required for the plant is estimated at $110.8 million. The plant is designed to achieve
a production rate of 100 kta of polymer-grade DMC. The energy consumption for producing
DMC is calculated at 34.6 MJ/kg DMC, and the process generates CO emissions of 0.38 kg CO
per kg of DMC produced. Significant safety concerns include handling hazardous chemicals
such as Ethylene Oxide (EO), Methanol (MeOH), and Aniline, which pose risks due to their
flammability, explosiveness, and toxicity. As such, we can not recommend building of this
plant under current market rates for chemicals
